The pinnacle of academic achievement ‚Äî another "Hello World" tier ASP.NET project, crafted under the sweet pressure of a looming deadline. Because why make it easy when you can have operands like `%eax` and `$0x42`?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer & Managed Expectations

*   **Goal:** Pass the exam. Not to build the next Dev.to.
*   **Complexity:** Glorified to-do list level. Don't expect Docker or Kubernetes orchestration.
*   **Architecture:** It's "works on my machine" certified.
*   **Content:** The tests blog posts are probably more interesting than the code itself. They're about assembly, for heaven's sake.

## üß™ What's Inside? (The Tech Stack of Survival)

*   **Frontend:** Razor Pages, HTML, CSS, JS 
*   **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 
*   **Database:** Entity Framework Core + SQLite 
*   **Theme:** A blog about AT&T syntax 

## üöÄ How to Run (For the Brave and the Curious)

1.  Open VSCode.
2.  `git clone <this-repo>`
3.  `dotnet ef migrations add "InitialCreate"`
4.  `dotnet ef database update`
5.  `dotnet watch run`
6.  Open browser. Sign up.
7.  Read the only blog post. Finally understand what `movl %ebp, %esp` does (no). Your life is now changed (no).
